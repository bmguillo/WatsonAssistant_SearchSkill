In Watson Assistant Plus/Premium, there are two skills. A dialog skill and a search skill(beta) currently. Previously, there was only built-in capability for short tail search using the dialog skill. The search skill now provides a means of performing a long tail search using Watson Discovery integration for self-service.More reasons for implementing long tail search in Watson Assistant can be found in this blog: https://medium.com/ibm-watson/adding-search-to-watson-assistant-99e4e81839e5
